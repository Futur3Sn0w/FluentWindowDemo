# FluentWindowDemo
 Exploring what an explorer-based window could look like with Fluent Design

## What is this?
This is an HTML/CSS demo of what a window could look like with Fluent Design. The idea is that some things will be changed from normal Windows; specifically window borders, hover effect, etc. You'll be able to see and test these in the demo.

## What's the point?
I dunno. It's kinda fun to play around with HTML/CSS styling, so I thought it could be fun to see what I could do here.

# Enjoy!!!
